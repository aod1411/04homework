# Coding Quiz

A fun quiz testing out user's coding knowledge and skills!

## Description

A timed quiz testing coding students on their basic knowledge regarding HTML. If you get a question wrong it will remove 10 seconds from the timer and when you finish the quiz will grade the quiz and give you a score and ask for user initials.

## User Story

I want to be able to test my students so I have created a quiz that can be deployed to them and grades the quiz automatically.
